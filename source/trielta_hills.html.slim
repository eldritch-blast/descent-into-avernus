p
  | The Trielta Hills contain scattered small settlements of gnomes and halflings, where life seems pastoral and idyllic. Halfling farmers tend to their plots, and gnome miners scrape out the interior of the hills seeking bits of gold and silver. No warlords threaten this land, no liches or dragons plot to seize it. There are no great castles to covet here, nor ruins to pillage. The residents enjoy their solitude, which is broken only rarely.

h4 Hardbuckler

p
  | At the southern edge of the hills lies the walled settlement of Hardbuckler. It is a town of mostly gnomes, with the occasional human, halfling, or half-elf among them. It is well-defended by batteries of ballistae on cog-run cranking mounts that allow for a nearly constant cycle of firing and reloading. Though they rarely see use, these defensives weapons deter bandits and raiders.

p
  | The town has a single street running inside the circular outer wall, and another pair of roads crossing north-to-south and east-to-west that meet in the center of town to form a crossroads marketplace. Along the roads there are many buildings designed to accommodate larger folk, but the rest of the town is made up of a series of narrow paths between the smaller-proportioned buildings that are the homes of the townâ€™s gnomes.

p
  | Beneath each small dwelling is an extensive cellar, often three or more levels in depth, where the industrious folk of Hardbuckler engage in their livelihoods. Some are shops or workspaces for artisans, while others rent out extra space to travelers, setting aside a few rooms for rent and a single large space as an open taproom serving mushrooms, potatoes, turnips, dense lichens, and stews made of shrews and voles. These spaces are well-heated by generous hearths and quite comfortable.
